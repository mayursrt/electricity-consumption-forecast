## Inroduction

With the development of smart meters, electric utilities can obtain precise and detailed
data of single consumers. This has lead to the generation of various big data sets with
previously unattainable information leading to efficient smart grid performance in areas
such as load forecasting. Accurate load forecasting promotes effective functioning of smart
grids and power system ultimately leading to proper utilization of resources and avoidance
of power outages. Meter level predictions, also known as domestic level forecasting, for
short period of time finds applications in load scheduling, management of demand response
and storage systems. This report describes the use of an approach combined using Seasonal
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous (SARIMAX) and Long Short Term
Memory networks (LSTM) with regression models to predict daily energy consumption of
customers located in London area.
